# Agenttools Project

## Overview
This project is a Java Spring Boot application that demonstrates various features including conversation management, message handling, and integration with OpenAI's LLM using the Spring AI framework. It uses H2 as the primary database for persistence.

## Sakila Database Sample

The Sakila database sample used in this project is provided by the author of the [hibernate/sakila-h2](https://github.com/hibernate/sakila-h2) repository.

- The Sakila sample database is a well-known schema originally created by MySQL for demonstrating database features and best practices.
- More information about the Sakila schema, its tables, and usage can be found in the [official MySQL Sakila documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Configure your environment** (see `application.yml` for database and OpenAI settings)
3. **Run the application** using your preferred IDE or with `mvn spring-boot:run`

## Notes
- The H2 database is used for local development and testing.
- The Sakila schema is included for demonstration and learning purposes.
